# This game has been moved
Sadly this game is moved because GitHub doesn't allow files bigger than 100mb. We have moved to BitBucket so you're still able to download and use our game!
# How to play the game
There two ways you can play the game.
First there's the simple version. You can just go to [releases](https://github.com/CSMdevs/EnglishGame/releases) and download the version available for windows.
If you want to play on Mac, Linux or any other OS, you'll have to clone the [source code](https://bitbucket.org/csm-devs/englishgame/src/master/).
